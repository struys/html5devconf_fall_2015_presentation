- These services would return HTML instead of JSON
- Users would be able to go from the routing layer directly to a UI outside of the monlith
- And our product teams would be able to iterate extremely quickly on this well isolated
section of a site

- You can make libraries and services have various restrictions on what versions they use

- in the second example we're saying, anything from 1.8-1.9 is fine, any patches between are acceptable
- in the third that syntax says anything in the 1 release is fine, minors and patches are good
- in the last example we're being very explicit, we only work with the 2nd patch version of 1.9
